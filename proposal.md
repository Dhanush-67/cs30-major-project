# Project Description

My project will be a space shooter game where we will be controlling a spaceship with which we will have to defend
earth.

## Needs to have list
- A movable spaceship that can shoot bullets
- An earth with a specific hp and gets damaged when hit by asteroids
- Asteroids that randomly float across the screen dealing damage when they hit something
- A portal that can take the spaceship to a different location(If i can I might make the camera move along with the spaceship so when we can just keep going towards the right of earth to our new location)
- The different location can be explored(We will be going to another planet where we will fight enemies and get resources) and has some enemies and loot
- Make the enemies attack the player
- Use the loot to buy something from the "shop" or make upgrades
- sounds
- graphics

## Nice to have list
- Make the enemies smart
- Add some cool stuff to the shop like turrets and shields
- Make the shop look good
- Make the different locations spawn randomly
- As the game progresses the difficulty should also progress
- Maybe add accserioes in the shop
